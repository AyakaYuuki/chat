I just asked her, and she turned me down. Now I'm super mad at you, and its purely your fault. I'll go to the darknet and get a hacker to destroy your whole life, so that you cant ever do such horrible things again.

Its difficult to be mean in a way that the other person gets that its a joke, while still insulting them and cutting deep.

Actually, I could've gone far deeper, but I wont, because you wouldnt get that its a joke then..
