Thats actually quite interesting. I always respected you kaboom, since I thought that you are one of the smarter ones in here, who actually thinks before he says something. 
I dont know what this was, but what I know for sure, is that nobody benefits from that, which means that its redundant. Not just that, its also a negative comment.

I personally recommend not to do those things, since it doesnt feel like it now, but it'll hit back some time.
Instead of wasting your time writing those kinds of comments, why dont you join me in my meditational hours?

@Nice talk bro


**Nice talk bro**
Ayaka is just getting offended by a joke :P
 

**Ayaka Yuuki**
as always


**Nice talk bro**
I appreciate the literature essay trying to defend your honor in some way Ayaka, but I really don't need the respect of someone like you. Nobody was supposed to benefit from my small joke. For the record I've never been to keen on your actions anyways. I'm not looking to poke my nose in your business, but you're one to talk when it comes to positive and negative behavior buddy.
I would like to politely decline your offer to meditate. If you feel the need to "hit back" because of two words on a screen then I suggest you find an action more suited to calm whatever is unnerving you right now. 

I don't appreciate threats. 
xoxo Have a nice day :heart:

I am impressed. I've never had a debate thats this way before, reading your message, I can see that there are no arguments but yet there is the problem that your only argument seems to be that you want to silently insult the person you're fighting while still giving everyone the feeling that you never said anything bad. `I'm not looking to poke my nose in your business, but you're [not the] one to talk when it comes to positive and negative behavior buddy.`
Anyway, thank you for preparing me for those kinds of situations, since the main two discussion types I had before were either discussions where its the arguments that count and the sides try to convince eachother, or its atleast one side that doesnt really pick up the arguments the opposite side had.
So yeah, again, thanks for preparing me for a situation, where nobody seems to be able properly react to what the previous message said but still pretends to properly do it.

`One element of conversation is discussion: sharing opinions on subjects that are thought of during the conversation. In polite society the subject changes before discussion becomes dispute or controversial. For example, if theology is being discussed, no one is insisting a particular view be accepted.`
Since your way of discussing actually applies on its definition, it is a proper but redundant strategy, which should be replaced world wide as fast as possible.

If you know how to change the habits people have all over the world, please tell me how.


Have a great evening and a painful death before the humans extinct in the next ten years.


**Nice talk bro**
So I'm fighting you now? I never said that I'm some sort of godsent Ayaka. You're getting upset over two words comprised of pixels on a screen. An argument with you is the only redundant part of this conversation that I see. What would you expect me to say in this case Ayaka?

My opinion in this case is the memes that you steal/make have been bad as far as I can think back into recent memory. Just as you could claim that my argument is bad or flawed. What we have in this case is an opinion Ayaka Yuuki. You appear to be fairly familiar with the term, and wish for me to have one in this argument, but get offended when I have one.

I'm not perfect, and I have done many wrongs. What I mean when saying "I'm not looking to poke my nose in your business, but you're one to talk when it comes to positive and negative behavior buddy" is that you've done something in recent memory that a majority of people would see as 'wrong' compared to me having an opinion on meme posts. 

I'm not looking to be your rival here, but at the same time I'm not a pushover.
There's no need to say that we're 'fighting' now unless that is what you're truly seeking buddy


**Ayaka Yuuki**
Let me answer in the wrong way, by taking your last paragraph to the first paragraph.

`There's no need to say that we're 'fighting' now unless that is what you're truly seeking buddy` By the common definition of a fight done by words, we are fighting right now. But I dont care whether you call it fight or discussion, since the only thing I want to take out of it as of right now is knowledge. I dont expect anyone to give me more than experience, which is obviously not collected by the result, you get it by tracking its path and connecting your previously connected data with your newly connected ones (This article explains pretty that AI learns via reading books that are made for children to learn our casual understanding of morals: https://www.wiwo.de/technologie/digitale-welt/serie-kuenstliche-intelligenz-programmierte-moralkeule/19241960-2.html).
Excuse me, but I personally dont know, if you know about the majority of people, and how do you know that what either of us did was obejectively wrong? Yes, I did steal it from this server, codebullet, which is a server mainly about AI since the YouTuber it belongs to creates videos about evolutionary AIs. https://discord.gg/tfckZvt

You sucessfully addressed the problem yourself, the problem is it, to have an opinion, being an opinion- and emotionless human, you could create something not even AI can do right now. You can create the true smartness. (In this TED talk, Tiffany Smith said, that emotions are some kind of short circuit in our brain, and those were pretty much meant to speed up to reactions. https://www.ted.com/talks/tiffany_watt_smith_the_history_of_human_emotions) This is why I want to fight against opinions, and want to empower the truth, no matter how much it hurts.

You never said, that you are godsent, well, not as far as I can remeber, but I can prove to you by using scientificically accepted thoughts in a newly accepted thought experiment, that you were "meant" to be here. I dont know if there is a god, but thats what I can tell you so far. 

Just to go even further with your comparision of how meaningless it is, first of all, its not even pixels, its electricity. Its moving neutrons that move from one cable from me to my router and from there on some "magic happens" that will transmit a similar datastring to you, which makes you think that I send it, but in reality, you have no evidence.

But thats going off topic, so lets head back to it - You're randomly typing in your keyboard to transmit a few electrons via the same magic mentioned above to some provider, which will possibly transmit them to me. The problem I see is, that you yourself are contradicting your own argument. What I'm essentially saying is that `You're getting upset over two words comprised of pixels on a screen.`addresses the problem that I write long messages because of such a tiny problem, but you yourself do the same, which is why you can actually use your own argument against yourself.


**Nice talk bro**
So despite how interesting that response is, I appear to miss how any of this relates to my overall points? Why did we need to bring up AI and how emotions are just like short-circuits? To put it lightly your moral compass seems to have a few more short-circuits than that of a regular person. I'm not looking to talk about this in the literal sense of things ayaka. Since we are fighting now I'm going to be a little less nice :> 

Try responding without pulling random articles out of your behind, for as enlightening as those would be, they are not relevant to this conversation.


**Ayaka Yuuki**
Okay, if you dont want proof from my side, thats great, thank you. I want proofs for your side, so why do you think that proofs are not necessary?


**Nice talk bro**
You have proved to me that opinions, while different to what an AI can create are quite the opposite of smartness.
Because AI 'proofs' do nothing to backup your arguments in this instance
I brought up the pixels on a screen not because I needed you to educate me on how technology works, but rather because you are getting upset over something so small.


**Ayaka Yuuki**
I think that point went over your head. I explained that, if you want to go that deep, we can go even further and say its just electrons moving from one part of my wire to another, and you waste ten minutes of your life just to move a few electrons back.
Anyway, take as much time as you want, I'll go sleep now since its almost midnight and I've to get up at 5:00AM. Since I dont have any phone available right now, I cant read your message on the go, which means that we'll be able to continue this in round about seventeen hours.
Good night.


**Nice talk bro**
The act of going deeper into a subject unrelated to a topic while "fighting" or while "in a debate" doesn't support your side in any way. You wanted an opinion and I gave you multiple to grab onto and respond as one would in a debate.

1. Your meme was bad (which was meant as a joke lol)
2. You get upset at me for not having an opinion, yet when I had one in the first place you got offended
3. I just now called out how you argue, which is pulling random facts out of your ass and citing them as proofs for something

I could care less and I honestly wouldn't have given you my time of day if it weren't for you threatening to "hit back" in the future.
Also,
"Have a great evening and a painful death before the humans extinct in the next ten years."
wishing people a painful death is mean and "I dont know what this was, but what I know for sure, is that nobody benefits from that, which means that its redundant. Not just that, its also a negative comment."


**Ayaka Yuuki**
`The act of going deeper into a subject unrelated to a topic while "fighting" or while "in a debate" doesn't support your side in any way. You wanted an opinion and I gave you multiple to grab onto and respond as one would in a debate.` Please explain to me what specifically that is supposed to response to. I do understand what you're trying to say, but I dont get what its supposed to relate with. Anyway, you gave me opinions, thats correct, and as I told you above, an opinion doesnt matter. Its the truth and the arguments that matter. Which is why I responded to those and told you not to give me opinions. Back to your `I gave you multiple [opinions]`, thats correct, you gave me multiple contradictory opinions about the same thing. `1. Your meme was bad (which was meant as a joke lol)` There we go again, you said multiple times, that it was meant as a joke, but on the other hand said that it was bad and wrong. Thats not considerable as a part of an argument, its not even an opinion. `2. You get upset at me for not having an opinion, yet when I had one in the first place you got offended`. I dont get upset on you for not having an opinion, I get upset because I want to, but thats a different thing.
Lets continue with your message:`3. I just now called out how you argue, which is pulling random facts out of your ass and citing them as proofs for something` Thats an interesting statement, thank you for giving me your opinion, this is what all this was about - improvement. You should've noticed that in my first message, but lets "counter" your "argument". You say, that I'm pulling facts that dont connect to the current topic out of nothing, thats obviously partly true, since you have to get your facts somewhere, but there is also a wrong part. I do react to what you said, and I give you studies and empower my argument by showing you the reasons behind it. Thats called argumentational pyramid, its not necessary to use, but its good when you can atleast understand it in common usage.
`I could care less and I honestly wouldn't have given you my time of day if it weren't for you threatening to "hit back" in the future.` I never threatened you, the only thing I said is that you'll have all time you need, since I'll be offline for now. I wouldnt hit back, since I consider it as "over" when you dont response.
`Also,
"Have a great evening and a painful death before the humans extinct in the next ten years."
wishing people a painful death is mean` No, its not. Please rethink it with the following premise: A death thats not painful, is a death thats not wanted. Saying that I wish you a painful death before the humans extinct basically means that I wish a death for you, thats not because of enviromental changes or other torture that happened around you, or in short, it means that I like you to have a good life.
`and "I dont know what this was, but what I know for sure, is that nobody benefits from that, which means that its redundant. Not just that, its also a negative comment."` Please explain further what you're trying to prove by quoting me. I appreciate it, that you remember what I wrote, but I do not think that it belongs in here.


**NaCL**
so much contradicts itself in this statement compared to what youve said before


**Ayaka Yuuki**
Oh, please explain where exactly those are.
